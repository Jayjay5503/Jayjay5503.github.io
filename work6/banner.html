			<h1>Volleyball</h1>
			<p>
				Volleyball is a dynamic and popular sport with a rich history that spans over a century. Its evolution
				reflects significant cultural, technological, and global changes that have shaped it into the widely
				enjoyed game we know today. Here is a comprehensive look at the evolution of volleyball:
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Origins (1895)</strong><br>
				Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director in Holyoke,
				Massachusetts, USA. Originally called "Mintonette," the sport was created as a less intense alternative
				to basketball. Morgan designed it for older YMCA members who sought physical activity without the
				rigorous demands of basketball. The initial setup used a tennis net raised to 6 feet 6 inches and a
				bladder from a basketball as the ball.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>1990s to Present</strong><br>
				The 1990s to the present marked a period of significant modernization and technological advances in
				volleyball. In 1996, beach volleyball made its Olympic debut at the Atlanta Games, adding a new
				dimension to the sport's global appeal. During this time, several rule changes were introduced to make
				the game faster and more spectator-friendly. Rally scoring replaced the traditional side-out scoring,
				ensuring that a point is scored on every serve. In 1998, the libero position was introduced to
				specialize in defensive play, further enhancing the strategic aspects of the game. Technological
				advances, such as video replays, advanced analytics, and enhanced broadcast capabilities, have not only
				improved the viewing experience but also added strategic depth to the sport.<br>

				Today, volleyball is played in almost every country and continues to thrive at both amateur and
				professional levels. The sport remains a prominent feature in the Summer Olympics, World Championships,
				and regional tournaments like the Asian Games and European Championships. Beach volleyball, in
				particular, has become a cultural phenomenon, combining athleticism with the allure of outdoor sports.
				The FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour has emerged as a marquee event. Additionally, innovations in
				equipment, such as lighter, more durable balls and advanced shoe and apparel designs, have significantly
				improved performance and player safety.
